# fake_news_detection
In this repository we have the complete fake news detection project with 10 different datasets and application of machine learning and deep learning models on them.
The datasets were taken from kaggle , google scholars, ieee and some other sources.
The datasets are ready to work as we have already merged the false and true data into one dataset and cleaned the data beforehand.
Along with that for each  dataset we have performed multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithm and then compared their accuracies and plotted them.
Apart from that we have performed some statistical tests like chi sqaure and friedman for comparing the accuracies of different models.
